This function counts string length using no pre defined functions. To test this code,
paste it into gdb online and select the c option. Then set the command line arguments
to ./strLength "placeholder" where placeholder is any string you would like to test.
Running this function shall then print and return the length of the string from
the command line argument.
This function runs at O(n) where n is the string length. Since strings are character
arrays in c and arrays in c do not track their length, I could not think of a more
efficient way to do this.
